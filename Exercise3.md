Connecting to Hyperscale (Citus) on Azure Database for PostgreSQL
When you create your Hyperscale (Citus) cluster, a default database named citus is created. To connect to your database server, you need a connection string and the admin password. Initial connections to Postgres may take up to 2 minutes. If for any reason your shell times out and you restart it you will need to perform the curl -s https://ifconfig.co command again and ensure the firewall is updated with the new IP address.
